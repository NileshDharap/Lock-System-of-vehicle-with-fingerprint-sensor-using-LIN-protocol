# Lock-System-of-vehicle-with-fingerprint-sensor-using-LIN-protocol
The project uses fingerprint sensor for recognition and LIN protocol for locking systems in a vehicle

- Arduino as Master.
- ESP8266 as a slave.
- MOSFET as Physical Layer to provide 12v line.
- Fingerprint sensor (UART) to Master. (Add the fingerprints before use)
- Refer IVN Report pdf for working.
